Developed an autonomous claw machine that retrieves objects based off of colour through the implementation of mechatronics principles. Achieved a **90% retrieval rate** through the design and construction of an autonomous claw machine using SOLIDWORKS, EV3 Robot and 3D printed components. Programmed in RobotC.


## What I did:

 - Developed the user-interface and autonomous functionalities such as scanning, pick up and drop off using RobotC
 
 - Implemented 10+ unit tests to handle unexpected input from the user and other unexpected errors
